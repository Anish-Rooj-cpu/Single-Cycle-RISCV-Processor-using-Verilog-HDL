# Single-Cycle-RISCV-Processor-using-Verilog-HDL
In this project I have designed a Single Cycle RISCV Processor using Verilog HDL
# Architecture Used :

# Instructions Supported
 The processor supports the **RISC-V base integer instruction set (RV32I)**, including:  
 - R-type: `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`, `sll` 
 - I-type: `addi`, `slti`, `lw`, `jalr`  
 - S-type: `sw`  
 - B-type: `beq`, `bne`, `blt`, `bge`  
 - J-type: `jal`

# Testing and Verificiation 
 The processor has been tested with various complex Programs like Factorial Determinaition, Sum of N natrual numbers, Bubble Sort and Fibonacci Series Generator.
 - The .asm files are assembled using a custom Assembler made by Python
